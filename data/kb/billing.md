# AcmeCloud Billing FAQ

## 1. I was charged twice. What should I do?
If you see a duplicate charge, first confirm you don’t have more than one AcmeCloud account using different email addresses.  
If the charge is still unexpected, contact support with the last 4 digits of the card, the charge date, and amount so we can investigate and refund any duplicate billing.

## 2. How long do refunds take?
Once a refund is approved, it usually appears on your statement within 5–10 business days, depending on your bank or payment provider.

## 3. Can I get a refund for the last invoice?
Refunds are evaluated case‑by‑case.  
We typically offer refunds when you were billed incorrectly (for example, duplicate subscriptions or technical errors) or could not use the service due to an outage.

## 4. When am I billed for my subscription?
AcmeCloud subscriptions renew automatically at the start of each billing cycle (monthly or yearly).  
You are charged on the renewal date using the primary payment method on file.

## 5. How do I update my payment method?
You can update your card details from the Billing section in your AcmeCloud account settings.  
New invoices and renewals will use the updated payment method.

## 6. What happens if a payment fails?
If a payment fails, we retry automatically a few times over the next 7 days.  
Your account may be temporarily limited until payment is successful; after that, all features are restored.

## 7. How do I get a copy of my invoices?
In the Billing → Invoices page, you can download PDFs of all past invoices.  
These include company name, address, tax information, and line‑item details.
