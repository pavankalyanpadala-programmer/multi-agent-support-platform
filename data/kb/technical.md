# AcmeCloud Technical Support FAQ

## 1. The dashboard is very slow. What can I check?
Slow dashboards are usually caused by heavy data ranges, complex queries, or network issues.  
First, try reducing the date range, closing extra browser tabs, and checking your internet connection stability.

## 2. I see an error when loading a report. What should I do?
Take a screenshot of the full error message and note the time it occurred.  
Try refreshing the page and, if possible, running the report with a smaller date range or fewer filters before contacting support.

## 3. The app will not load at all.
First, check our status page (or announcements) to see if there is an ongoing outage.  
If everything looks normal, try another browser or an incognito window and make sure VPN / firewall settings are not blocking AcmeCloud.

## 4. The dashboard data looks outdated.
Dashboards may be cached or refreshed on a schedule.  
Check the “Last Updated” timestamp on the page and trigger a manual refresh if available; if it still looks wrong, contact support with the dashboard name and example records.

## 5. I can’t log in to my account.
Verify that your email and password are correct and that Caps Lock is off.  
If you still cannot log in, use “Forgot password” to reset your credentials, then try again in a different browser.

## 6. I keep getting logged out.
For security reasons, AcmeCloud sessions expire after a period of inactivity.  
If you work in shared environments, this is expected; otherwise, clear your browser cache and cookies and sign in again.

## 7. I see random errors during peak hours.
High traffic can temporarily affect performance.  
Note the approximate times and regions affected and share them with support so we can correlate with system load and investigate.
